        desc: "This is a refactoring of The Coding Train’s Coding Challenge: Mathematical Rose Patterns. It uses the knowledge gained in the Natural Simulations course on Khan Academy in order to oscillate the constant used to calculate the polar coordinate of the current rose point. The constant, called k, is calculated by dividing a numerator by a denominator. This program oscillates the value of the denominator. This creates an interesting effect in which the rose, or rhodonea, cycles through a variety of forms with different numbers of petals. This project solidified both my understanding of the specified coding challenge and allowed me to utilize what I had already learned in the course in my own unique way.",

Previously, I had coded in a manner that was majoritively logic-based. The use of equations in the course, in combination with the logic I had already mastered, opened me up to a whole new way of learning. I now can understand the crossroads between logic and math, and further how an algorithm uses the two to accomplish something. I will continue to use this combination of concepts in my learning going forward, in both mathematics and sciences.",

In further learning, I will apply this concept of “a set of steps” to my work in a conscious manner, in order to get things done in an efficient and sensical way. Previous to taking this KA course, I had some knowledge of algorithms, specifically the breadth-first-search, but did not have a super solid grasp of the idea behind it. This course not only broadened the number of standard algorithms I know of, but also made me more comfortable with the idea and logical flow of algorithms, which I will now be able to implement into my own unique code.

A lot of errors I’ve had in the past, such as “overflows”, make more sense when you think of a computer as a machine, with limited abilities, rather than a magical thinking device. It also gave me foundations for how networks, algorithms and the internet really work. I will apply this knowledge in the future, both when working with software and hardware.',
