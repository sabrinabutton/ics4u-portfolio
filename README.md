# ICS4U Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my projects from ICS4U 2019. The portfolio acts as both an exam and a way to show off what I've done this semester.

## Portfolio Access
The portfolio can be accessed [here](https://sabrinabutton.github.io/ics4u-portfolio/). This portfolio was created December 2019 and January 2020 using React, HTML, JS and CSS along with various libraries.

### 3. How can you productively participate in the open-source community?
Open-source software is a type of development in which the community can choose to view, change and contribute to or distribute source code on a project. It’s essentially like saying “Hey, I’m writing this book that I think could be really helpful to a lot of people. I would really appreciate it if you could write a chapter, or maybe even just check my grammar!” This can be done by companies to a) generate interest and to b) improve their software based on the wants of the people. Additionally, an open source approach to development greatly reduces labour costs, as people essentially ‘volunteer’ to help develop the program, which can make the program much more accessible to the public as it can be made free to use due to the lack of budget it requires. Ultimately, the open-source community exists for people to use it. So in order for the community to continue to thrive, and for the world to continue to develop publicly accessible programs, those who use and rely on these programs should make a conscious effort to participate in this community, even if they are not directly contributing to the code. Opening issues, spreading knowledge of open source projects via social media, and even thanking the people who take time to develop these projects can help strengthen this community.

	I personally use a lot of open source libraries, as a lot of the time in web development you’re reinventing the wheel when there’s a super wheel you could use for free. Styled-components is probably my favorite open source library, as it allows me to style react components with CSS right in my javascript files, which makes my workflow a lot easier and more customizable. I have starred the Github repository for this library and if I ever run into an issue or have an idea for an improvement, I will be sure to either make an issue or contribute to the code on my own. But there is much more to open-source than that: you can engage on YouTube, Twitter, Reddit or even make your own open source project. Currently, I have no projects that I would qualify as substantial enough to make them open source, but some projects have been given an MIT license, giving anyone who wants to permission to contribute to my work. On social media, I try my best to engage with open source projects (especially on Reddit) and try to get the word out about these as much as possible. As a person who relentlessly relies on these free community projects, I feel it’s my duty to do my best to contribute to them.
