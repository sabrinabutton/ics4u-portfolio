# ICS4U Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my projects from ICS4U 2019. The portfolio acts as both an exam and a way to show off what I've done this semester.

## Portfolio Access
The portfolio can be accessed [here](https://sabrinabutton.github.io/ics4u-portfolio/). This portfolio was created December 2019 and January 2020 using React, HTML, JS and CSS along with various libraries.

### 1. What does it mean to have good programming practices?
There is no absolute universal method of code that is regarded as “good-practice”, but rather there are small things one can do in order to make their code objectively better. A good rule of thumb is that good code is simple code. It is arguable that any solid, redistributable open source project should have code that has the potential to be understood by another programmer, in that it is concise, well documented and effective to its goals. Thus, the most important thing, in my personal opinion, in regards to having good programming practices, is that code should be able to be universally understood. This way, code can be updated and refined and overall is likely more logical.

The first principle of being understandable is conciseness. Concise code is achieved through code that is reusable and free of repetition. For example, this would mean programming functionally or in an object oriented manner, so that the same code can be called without unnecessary rewrites. This makes code more logical, and allows for easier understanding since it becomes easier to tell what each function or prototype on an object is doing, and why it needs to be doing that. Secondly, code should be well documented. Not meaning that every line has to have a comment saying “//this is an if statement to see if x is true”, that would be redundant. Code should have comments that explain WHY something is being done for the greater of the program. So to better the above, “//check if x is true before proceeding to initialize to avoid error with y”. This too, makes code easier to follow. Lastly, code should be effective to its goals. By this, I mean it should do what the author intended it to do by the most accurate and recognizable means possible. A calculator app, for example, should be functional and also recognizable, conventionally, to be a calculator. This allows others to see where the program as a whole can be improved and renders a greater understanding of it. Overall, these methods, which are just some of what can be considered “good programming practices” greatly improve the cleanliness of the development workflow for both the original author and other contributors.
### 2. How does version control allow you to learn more about coding Principles?
(W.I.P.)
### 3. How can you productively participate in the open-source community?
Open-source software is a type of development in which the community can choose to view, change and contribute to or distribute source code on a project. It’s essentially like saying “Hey, I’m writing this book that I think could be really helpful to a lot of people. I would really appreciate it if you could write a chapter, or maybe even just check my grammar!” This can be done by companies to a) generate interest and to b) improve their software based on the wants of the people. Additionally, an open source approach to development greatly reduces labour costs, as people essentially ‘volunteer’ to help develop the program, which can make the program much more accessible to the public as it can be made free to use due to the lack of budget it requires. Ultimately, the open-source community exists for people to use it. So in order for the community to continue to thrive, and for the world to continue to develop publicly accessible programs, those who use and rely on these programs should make a conscious effort to participate in this community, even if they are not directly contributing to the code. Opening issues, spreading knowledge of open source projects via social media, and even thanking the people who take time to develop these projects can help strengthen this community.

I personally use a lot of open source libraries, as a lot of the time in web development you’re reinventing the wheel when there’s a super wheel you could use for free. Styled-components is probably my favorite open source library, as it allows me to style react components with CSS right in my javascript files, which makes my workflow a lot easier and more customizable. I have starred the Github repository for this library and if I ever run into an issue or have an idea for an improvement, I will be sure to either make an issue or contribute to the code on my own. But there is much more to open-source than that: you can engage on YouTube, Twitter, Reddit or even make your own open source project. Currently, I have no projects that I would qualify as substantial enough to make them open source, but some projects have been given an MIT license, giving anyone who wants to permission to contribute to my work. On social media, I try my best to engage with open source projects (especially on Reddit) and try to get the word out about these as much as possible. As a person who relentlessly relies on these free community projects, I feel it’s my duty to do my best to contribute to them.
