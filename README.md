# ICS4U Portfolio
This repository contains a portfolio of my projects from ICS4U 2019. The portfolio acts as both an exam and a way to show off what I've done this semester.

## Portfolio Access
The portfolio can be accessed [here](https://sabrinabutton.github.io/ics4u-portfolio/).

## Notes
This portfolio was created December 2019 using React, HTML, JS and CSS along with various libraries.
Projects still need to be added to the site as the current version is simply a blank template I made to make the process quicker later-on.
